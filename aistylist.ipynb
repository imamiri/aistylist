Stick to solid colors or subtle prints/patterns. A wrap dress can be a flattering option. Accessorize with heels and jewelry.\\n\\n- A skirt and blouse combo, like a knee-length pencil skirt with a fancy silk top. Make sure the skirt and top are in dressier, wedding-appropriate fabrics. Wear heels.\\n\\n- Wide-leg pants or jumpsuit with heels and a dressy top or blazer on top. The pants should be in a wedding-ready material like crepe; a sequined or satin top would look great for a wedding.\\n\\n- For a daytime or more casual wedding, a floral sundress with wedges or dressy sandals could work too. Opt for a fancier sundress with nicer accents.\\n\\nSome tips: Avoid wearing white, cream or ivory so you don't clash with the bride. Steer clear of overly revealing outfits. Make sure to wear proper undergarments so your silhouette looks smooth. And check the wedding invitation for any preferred dress code details. Time of day and formality can also help guide your outfit choice.\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"stop\":\"\\n\\nHuman:\"}\n"
